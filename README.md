The cyber threat landscape is highly active at this time. I am documenting the following observations, as I find it increasingly difficult to contact support centers.

* Given the current threat landscape, I am operating Firefox in **Strict Mode**, though I also experience the following difficulties after disabling Strict Mode:
	* After purchasing a subscription, I have not been able to log in to my ChatGPT account for two weeks. I have contacted OpenAI about this issue three times, with no response.
	* In the past week, I've experienced difficulties accessing support from OpenAI, Etsy, and Upwork; in part due to "auto-refreshing" occuring in the help center portals. 
* This week, I noticed strange behavior in one of my Proton email accounts. I received a series of about 10 emails, which were dated as having been delivered approximately one week before.
* Similar delays are occurring with my text messages. The Current Period call time on my iPhone is listed at approximately 21 hours, though my phone has been off for upwards of 90% of the time in the last 1-2 months. I made few calls in the months prior, (i.e. the beginning of the period.)

I am monitoring the landscape to the best of my ability, and will be modifying my social strategy accordingly. I hope this information proves useful to anyone experiencing similiar frustrations.
